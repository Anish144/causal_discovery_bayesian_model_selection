- Changed the weights to reduce possible sources of bias. Now we assign total weight 1 to all the cause-effect pairs that are taken from the same dataset.
- Corrected links in pair0076
- Replaced pair0068 by a new data set with the same type of variables. The records were incomplete about how the original pair from the http-server at Vilnius University was measured. We now generated data from the log files of the http server at MPI IS.  (25.Nov.2014) 
- Added new pair0088
- Fixed error in README: the two column descriptions for pair0084 were swapped.
- Updated pair0072_des
- Updated pair0072 (data was downloaded again, looked slightly different)
- Updated pair0043-46 (data was downloaded again, looked slightly different)
- Updated pair0048 (data between x and y was mixed together)
- Several description files updated
- pair0086: Removed two instances (one where apartment size = 0 m^2, one where price = 1 euro).
- pair0022: Removed two instances (one with length = 680 cm, one with length = 780 cm).
- pair0076: Removed empty line.


Version 0.9 released on October 23, 2014, consisting of 86 pairs.

- pair0038, pair0039, pair0040, pair0041: Removed all instances that have zero values
  for BMI, serum insulin, diastolic blood pressure and plasma glucose concentration,
  because we believe that these encode for missing data.
